# Data-Analysis-with-R-course-work
This repository contains my answers to some of the quiz of this course
<br>
 <br>
(1) Explore one variable:   Gapminder data: Life expectancy. 
<br>
 <br>
(2) Analyze friends' birthday data
 <br>
  <br>
(3) Explore two variables of Gapminder data: life expectancy vs GDP
<br>
        Key observation: life expectancy of different countries are strongly correlated with log of GDP
<br>
 <br>
 (4) Explore multiple variables of Gapminder data: cancer mortality, GDP, life expectancy, CO2 emission, BMI, employment rate, population density
<br>
        Key observations:
         <br>
        (a) BMI has strong positive correlation with employment rate
                          <br>
                         (b) life expectancy of different countries are strongly correlated with log of GDP
                          <br>
                         (c) CO2 emission has strong positive correlation with GDP
                          <br>
                         (d) life expectancy of different countries are strongly correlated with log of CO2 emission
                          <br>
                         (e) population density doesn't seem to correlated with any other indicators.
                          <br>
                         (e) BMI, cancer mortality and employment rate have close to normal distribution
                          <br>
                         (f) life expectancy, CO2 emission, population density and GDP have bimodal distribution
                          <br>
