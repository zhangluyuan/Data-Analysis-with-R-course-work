This is the final quiz of lesson 8. 
<br>
<br>
Multiple indicators were downloaded from Gapminder: cancer, gdp, employment rate, bmi, life expectancy, population density, CO2 emission.
<br>
<br>
Data were cleaned, aggregated and merged before analysis
<br>
<br>
Key observation:
         <br>
        (a) BMI has strong positive correlation with employment rate
                          <br>
                         (b) life expectancy of different countries are strongly correlated with log of GDP
                          <br>
                         (c) CO2 emission has strong positive correlation with GDP
                          <br>
                         (d) life expectancy of different countries are strongly correlated with log of CO2 emission
                          <br>
                         (e) population density doesn't seem to correlated with any other indicators.
                          <br>
                         (e) BMI, cancer mortality and employment rate have close to normal distribution
                          <br>
                         (f) life expectancy, CO2 emission, population density and GDP have bimodal distribution
                          <br>
